    <h1>Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 and Forest Development</h1>

    <p>In 2014, Government of Tamil Nadu launched <strong>“Vision Tamil Nadu 2023”</strong>, which stresses on maintaining ecological balance across the State and emphasizes tree cover outside forest as the single most important and cost-effective strategy for achieving the goal of 33% forest and tree cover.</p>

    <p>Forests provide the basic life support system to all the living entities of mother earth including mankind. Forest ecosystems provide fresh air, water resources, fertile soil and agriculture, biodiversity and environment. Vast sections of rural society, including a majority of the tribal population, are directly dependent on forests for their livelihood. Forest degradation will have an adverse impact on these life-supporting systems.</p>

    <p>The Government of Tamil Nadu recognizes the prospects of a balanced ecosystem in advancing the socio-economic development of the State. The pursuance of policy of environmental stability mandating afforestation and biodiversity conservation through people’s movement has led to an increase in forest cover.</p>

    <h2>Forest Status as per ISFR 2019</h2>

    <p>As per the latest <strong>India State of Forest Report, 2019 (ISFR)</strong>, the forest cover in the State is <strong>26,364 sq. km.</strong> which is <strong>20.27%</strong> of the State’s Geographical area. Tamil Nadu has achieved an increase in forest cover of <strong>83.02 sq. km.</strong> as compared to ISFR 2017. This achievement is significant, considering the continuous challenge faced by the Forest Department due to increasing population pressure on forest resources.</p>

    <p>Tamil Nadu has also achieved an increase in <strong>tree cover of 159 sq. km.</strong> as per the ISFR 2019 (totaling <strong>4,830 sq. km.</strong>) as compared to ISFR 2017 (4,671 sq. km.). Tamil Nadu stands as a leading State among large States in consistently increasing its area under forest and tree cover.</p>

    <h2>Biodiversity and Wildlife Conservation</h2>

    <p>Tamil Nadu has been a <strong>pioneer State in Biodiversity conservation</strong>, especially in Protected Area management, including conservation and improvement of terrestrial and marine flora and fauna. The State’s sincere efforts in establishing a range of tiger habitats in the Western and Eastern Ghats have resulted in an increase in tiger numbers from <strong>229 in 2014</strong> to <strong>264 in 2018</strong>, as per the ‘Status of Tigers, Co-predators, and Prey in India’ report released by the Union Ministry for Environment, Forests and Climate Change.</p>

    <h2>Sustainable Development Goals</h2>

    <p>The <strong>United Nations Sustainable Development Summit</strong> adopted an action plan in 2015 for people, planet, and prosperity, and framed seventeen <strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong>. These goals are universally accepted and aim to balance three dimensions of sustainable development: Environmental, Social, and Economic.</p>

    <p>The Government of Tamil Nadu continues to be equally concerned about the vulnerability of natural resources due to climate change and is committed to sustainably manage and enhance forests and wildlife on scientific principles, while meeting the livelihood needs of forest-dependent communities.</p>
